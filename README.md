# javascript-challenge
For this javascript challenge I wrote a code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided](static/js/data.js). The code also allows the users to filter the table data for specific values. 
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* I used a date form in my HTML document and write JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
